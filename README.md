# object_distr
distribution of objects on the Cartesian plane
Task:
1. Using the internal random number generator RND scatter within the screen 10 - 1000 points with any distribution of their coordinates. Dots can be grouped or evenly distributed across the entire screen area.
2. Select the position of the three lines so that they form (separate) several areas, that is, at least four.
3. Find the parameters of these lines, for example, using the coordinates of the two points through which they pass. We give the equation of the line to the normal form.
4. Substitute the coordinates of the points in the normal equation and determine the sign of the distance. We paint the dots according to the sign. To do this, use the sweep principle and the corresponding logical predicates.
5. Draw up a report showing schematically the position of the lines on the screen and before the job protection, show the results. The report also provides snippets of the program concerning the operation of the separation distance algorithm, the principle of point selection and coloring, and the form of logical predicates.
